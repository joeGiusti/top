==========
random ideas:
mention things in questions that remind reader of things even if they are not the correct answer
ex: a ground lease is often used for farming and can be up to 99 years long so mentioning farming lease or 99 year lease before the correct answer will help to solidify that piece of information
another example: putting an answer choice for a vocab word that is going to be mentioned in the next slide will make it more familiar and more likely to be remembered
use fat dating and dopamine fast as motivational videos
==========

start with index

working on:
different things show when user clicks on class based on if they are the owner of it or not
guided study viewing page
guided study editing page

go thru the home page and understand how it all works
including js and firebase stuff

decide what the desired funciton is
make it happen

layers:
words
transparent torch
background color

user
  attempted modules
    moduleID    
      position: 0
      attempted questions

    questionID
      content: "question" 
      answers
        answerID
        correct:true

when clicked view check to see if module is in users attempted modules
if it is load their posiiton and show all tiles up to that one
if not set it to 0
when clicked "got it" show next tile abs increment position it in firebase


maybe just put atart and end times in video for now
ans questions go after that

for dark theme find all elements with class light theme
that will have no attributes so it will be default
add dark theme to those elements
dark theme will change their colors based on what kind of element they are

classes page will have add, browse, create buttons
in rowse it has info like the rating

hover over information icons in tiles area with description of wha it is doing

checkbox to select the correct answer in question tile

question by default asks the last 2 questions as well after the new one
questions by default cover up the last three questions or all
maybe just blur it out somehow or show a dark screen as to avoid disorientation

show password checkbox (show it by default though)

get the script link to work so same code can bo on all pages

landing page can be like firebase landing page
video in back with cards overlay
color image below with diagonal lines and still card overlays

live class chat would be cool
live chat at home page would also be cool

make it so the amount of text doesnt affect the card height

cards

1) save function will update the tiles array based on the tiles on the screen before updating or pushing to the db
position up and down will change the position for the tile and the one next to it with a temp tule holder
maybe make them all have the same class of tileDisplay and get elements by class
==========


custom card with background color

loads class modules and other stuff for the class

back button history to home from class page

maybe progressively less3 points, then 2 then 1 then 0
but maybe it comes back after a certain amount of time

account page
anonymous user is able to become a perminant user

clep courses
university professors tool (paid by students)
home schooling courses
teaching my self things
turn into real university

shows the number of sections completed, score, number left
questions saved in database and 
auto quiz option puts a quiz with all of the questions from before in random order
questions also show up in other places like pvp game and team game
maybe as passwords getting into doors in the labs

point system


more info button for classes in the browse catigory

stats about the number of people salaries, time to complete, etc

adding to modules is like tiles
they have an index in the databse
there are arrow buttons that change the index an reload (or just move)

save button, exit without saving button
on back pressed or on destroy save automatically

dark mode 
saves on profile and in browser

=====
when <module view> or <module edit> are clicked
set currentModuleId
use it to load all tiles from database into an array of tile class instances (similar to load classes info)
show the module edit or view section with display = normal, other displays = none
make tiles into html (depending on view or edit, listed below)

for View:
call refresh function that clears and puts html for each tile in the array (similar to use class id array)
only show the right ones somehow
for edit
call different refresh function that shows tiles in a differnet way
or maybe just have an editing variable that determines if refresh calls a different add html function
also will call differnet add html based on tyle type variable
call firebase update function when edits are made
save button that is a bright color when there are unsaved changes
add tile button creates a tile instance with some values and adds it ot the array
then you can edit the tile
